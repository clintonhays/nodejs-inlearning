Repository for Node,js Essential Training from inLearning

## What

This is my repo for working through the inLearning nodejs course.

## Why

I will use this repo to test the code in the course and to keep track of the things I learn. I will focus on documentation as I go and end with a repo that I can look back at when I have any questions about nodejs.
